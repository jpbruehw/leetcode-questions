# Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
# Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
# Explanation:
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
# rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
# Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
# Explanation: 
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

def rotate(nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:

    n = len(nums)
    if k == 0 or k == n or n == 0:
        return nums
    j = k % n
    last_j = nums[-j:]
    # remove them from list
    nums[:] = nums[:-j]
    # replace k at front
    nums[:] = last_j + nums
